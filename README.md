## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

**"The Midnight Hustle: A Dev’s Journey"**

🌙 **12 AM** – Still on a trip, still coding. The email? Found it in spam. Why was I looking in the inbox? Because that’s how it works at midnight.

☕ **12:30 AM** – Coffee time. The fuel for any late-night dev session. GNews API docs? Like reading ancient hieroglyphs, but hey, I’ve cracked tougher puzzles in life.

🔑 **1 AM** – Finally! I unlock the secret key to the API like I’m Nicholas Cage in *National Treasure*.

🎨 **1:30 AM** – Dribbble scroll. Judging my own work with brutal honesty. Then… bam! I find the design that speaks to me—love at first sight.

🛠️ **2 AM** – Time to make it pixel-perfect with Tailwind. Suddenly, my humble project is turning into a work of art. Yes, *art*.

🌍 **3 AM** – Now adding country filters, language filters. It’s alive! My little news app baby is growing fast.

🌅 **5 AM** – The masterpiece is complete. It's a sleek online newspaper, perfect for sipping coffee and catching up on headlines. Tea drinkers, you’re welcome too, but I’ll stick to my coffee.

🛌 **Next Morning** – I wake up, stretch, and realize… **Oh no!** I forgot the final step! I didn’t deploy my masterpiece! *Gasp.*

🔥 **Firebase to the rescue!** – I install Firebase faster than I can brew my second cup of coffee, and boom—deployment in progress.

🚀 **Fully deployed** – My news app is now live and shareable. People can kick back, relax, and scroll through the latest headlines with ease.

⏰ **Deadline Approaching** – I scramble to fill out the submission form, attach my project, and hit submit just before the buzzer.

And with that, **mission accomplished**. The project is live, shared, and submitted. Now… I think I’ve earned myself another cup of coffee. ☕

**"Challenges: The Plot Twists"**

🔌 **API Shenanigans**: GNews.io’s API was being moody. Slow data rendering, asynchronous chaos! Enter Axios, the superhero that streamlined my requests and stopped React from re-rendering like it was in a race.

📱 **Responsive Drama**: Tailwind CSS had me juggling screen sizes like a circus act. With some extra testing and Tailwind's responsive utilities, I tamed the UI beast and made it sleek on all devices. 

⚡ **Vite's Speed Bumps**: Hot-reloading in Vite wasn’t so hot. A quick dependency update and some tweaks, and suddenly, it’s back to blazing speed. Crisis averted!

⚠️ **Error Mayhem**: The app was crashing like a toddler in a tantrum whenever the network failed. Added better error handling and a fallback UI to keep things calm under pressure.

📉 **Pagination Woes**: GNews.io's free tier hit me with a 10-request limit, killing my pagination dreams. But hey, I worked around it!
